# Future Ideas for the CI/CD Queue Simulator

Here are some ideas for future improvements to make the simulation more interesting and realistic:

1.  **Job Priorities:**
    Introduce different priority levels for jobs (e.g., high, medium, low). High-priority jobs could be picked from the queue first, or they could even preempt lower-priority jobs that are already running. This would add a new layer of scheduling complexity and allow you to explore how to handle urgent tasks.

2.  **Heterogeneous Machine Clusters:**
    Instead of all machines being identical, we could introduce different types of machines (e.g., "standard", "high-memory", "GPU-enabled"). Jobs could then have requirements for specific machine types. This would model a more realistic, complex infrastructure and add challenges in resource allocation.

3.  **Autoscaling Simulation:**
    We could implement an autoscaler that automatically adjusts the number of machines based on the queue length or the "Needed Machines" metric. You could configure the autoscaler's rules (e.g., scaling thresholds, cooldown periods) and see how it performs under different loads.

4.  **Cost Analysis:**
    We could add a cost model to the simulation. Each machine would have an associated cost per hour, and the simulation would track the total infrastructure cost. This would allow you to analyze the trade-offs between performance and cost, and to find the most cost-effective configuration for your workload.

5.  **Failure and Resilience Simulation (Chaos Engineering):**
    To test the system's resilience, we could introduce random machine failures. A machine could suddenly stop working, and the job it was running would need to be requeued. This would allow you to see how your system handles unexpected failures and to design more resilient queuing strategies.
